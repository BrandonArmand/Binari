## Contributing
[![Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-raw/brandonarmand/binari?maxAge=25000)](https://github.com/brandonarmand/binari/issues)  
Anyone can help. We welcome first-time contributors, as well as experienced contributors.

There is plenty to do for both developers and designers of every skill level. Check out the issues, or pitch your own ideas.

### Starting points.
- New to open-source? I suggest fixing a spelling error or try doing a [first-timers-only](https://github.com/BrandonArmand/Binari/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afirst-timers-only) issue.
- Expert on all things binary tree? Try [building a lesson](https://github.com/BrandonArmand/Binari/issues/8).
- Designer? Don't be shy, we could use some work with our [designs](https://github.com/BrandonArmand/Binari/issues/7).

### Rules
1. Read the rules!
2. Issues tagged with `first-timers-only` are reserved for new contributors. Let them have a chance.
3. Each pull request should only introduce a single update at a time. Do not reference multiple issues that are unrelated to one-another.
4. Attempt to match the coding style of the project.
5. Adhere to the Code of Conduct, outlined below.

### Setup and Contributing Changes
1) Fork the repo into your GitHub account (available in the top right corner).

2) Clone the forked repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/<yourgithubaccount>/Binari.git
```

3) Navigate to the Binari directory and create/switch to a new branch.
```
cd Binari
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

4) Make changes to files. To see the changes you are making reflected in the application, run
```
npm install
npm start
```
Build the project.

5) Add the edited files and commit your changes.
```
git add <files>
git commit -m "<add message describing your changes>"
```

6) Push the changes to the remote repo.
```
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```
In the future, you can simply push to this branch by running `git push`.

7) Navigate back to your forked version of the project, where GitHub will ask if you would like to open a Pull Request. Create a PR, adding a description of your changes, the purpose of the changes, and a link to the issue you are solving.

8) Your PR will be reviewed by other members, who will either approve the merge or request changes.
